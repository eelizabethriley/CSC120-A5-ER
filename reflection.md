When configuring the Banner to resize with the message length, I wanted to use the length() method to create an int variable mLength that I could reuse in the print statements, but it kept throwing errors when I was doing this so I resorted to just calling the length() method on the variable message in each line. I'd like to figure out what went wrong here for my future self, but I couldn't tell what exactly was raising the problem.
